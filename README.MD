BRIOS is a low level OS 'modern OS' made in Ruby. Started as a crazy idea for my senior final 
project. This runs from terminal by using "ruby start.rb") like anything else. As I'm still learning
Ruby this is going be a little 'hacked' together.

Planned features:
-------------
+ Calculator
+ Notes
+ Text editor
+ Multi user support
+ Multi threading(maybe)
+ Password encryption
+ Data encryption

Current TODO:
-------------
- [ ] Finish first run process
	- [ ] Create needed files/folders 
	- [ ] First run configuration save to file 
- [ ] Password encryption working
- [ ] login system working
- [ ] Enable Multi Thread support
- [ ] Get notes working
	- [ ] Enable file opening and closing 
	- [ ] Enable file output
	- [ ] Enable file editing (last to be done)

Issues:
-------------
+ issue #01: Not running due to some dumb issue
 
Ideas:
-------------
+ Windows like login 'screen'
